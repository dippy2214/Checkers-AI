# Checkers AI ðŸ’» 
This is a project is a monte-carlo search tree based checkers AI made for my CMP304 module at Abertay uni. I had a great time working on this project 
(this was actually one of my favourite modules) and I got to explore an area of programming I had been interested in for quite a while. A project I
have always been interested in is making a chess engine which is capable of beating me at chess (I maintain a solid 1800+ rating on chess.com), and
this program makes use of a lot of core principles and logic which I could apply to chess if I chose.
