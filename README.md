# Checkers AI üíª 
This is a project is a monte-carlo search tree based checkers AI made for my CMP304 module at Abertay uni. I had a great time working on this project 
(this was actually one of my favourite modules) and I got to explore an area of programming I had been interested in for quite a while. A project I
have always been interested in is making a chess engine which is capable of beating me at chess (I maintain a solid 1800+ rating on chess.com), and
this program makes use of a lot of core principles and logic which I could apply to chess if I chose.

## The Development Process üõ† 

### üê£ Start At The Start
Looking at what I wanted to create for this project, I very quickly noticed the immediate problem. I wanted to make a checkers AI, but I had no checkers.
My starting point was clear. This project would take place in two parts, the making of checkers and the creation of the AI, and so I could power on
making checkers immediately with relatively little thought for the future. As I will explain shortly, this line of thought was deeply flawed, but some
lessons have to be experienced to be learned. For now I was happily on my way making a quick version of checkers, following along with the first quick
